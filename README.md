## How do Americans spent their lives?
A pressing, yet possibly terrifying question. The 2014 Census data has been examined to answer the question of how balanced our lives are in the US. That is, what is the mind, body, spirit balance among different groups?

# Where can I find the analysis?

It is in a jupyter notebook at https://github.com/unknown6238/atus-analysis/blob/master/ATUS-Analysis.ipynb.

# How do you get the data?

The categories of mind, body, and spirit were built by going through the multitude of categories in the census and identifying those that would be considered taking care of the body (eg. exercise and grooming), mind (eg. school and reading), or spirit (eg. religious activity). 

There is, of course, disagreement about what constitutes a spiritual activity as what recharges one person's soul amy do nothing for another. For example, hiking through the woods may be a spiritual activity for some, but just exercise for another. This same example illustrates that categories also have overlaps.

The data analysis can be improved by looking even more carefully over the activity categories to determine if any others should be added to any categories - time was a factor for going into as much depth as needed for a very accurate data set. This analysis does give a good base for future investigation though.
