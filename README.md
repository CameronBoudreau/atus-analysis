##How do Americans spent their lives?
A pressing, yet possibly terrifying question. The 2014 Census data has been examined to answer the following questions from broadest to most specific:

1.What is the balance of work, leisure, and caring for others for different age groups?
2.What is the most popular leisure activity for different groups?
3.What groups spend the most time alone?
4.What groups read the most?
5.Mind, body, spirit balance among groups.
